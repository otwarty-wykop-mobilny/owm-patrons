# owm patrons

A simple proxy script written in `go` that exposes the `patrons.json` file using an api hosted on [now](https://zeit.co/now). This API is used by the [OWM](https://github.com/otwarty-wykop-mobilny/WykopMobilny) app to display a badge for users who have backed the project on patronite.
